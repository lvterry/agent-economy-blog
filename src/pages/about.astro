    <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem; line-height: 1.8;">
      The agent economy represents a new paradigm where AI agents autonomously perform tasks, 
      make decisions, and generate economic value. From software engineering to content creation, 
      customer service to financial trading, AI agents are becoming capable economic actors.
